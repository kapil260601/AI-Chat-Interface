It uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and make informed decisions.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Often requires feature engineering (manual selection of relevant data features)\n- Works well with structured data\n- Typically requires less computational power\n- Can work effectively with smaller datasets\n- Examples: Random Forests, SVMs, Gradient Boosting, k-means clustering\n\n## Deep Learning\n\nDeep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze various factors of data.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Automatically performs feature extraction\n- Excels with unstructured data (images, text, audio)\n- Requires significant computational resources\n- Generally needs large amounts of data\n- Uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers\n- Examples: CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers\n\n## Summary of Differences\n\n| Aspect | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Data requirements | Can work with smaller datasets | Typically needs large amounts of data |\n| Feature engineering | Often manual | Automatic feature extraction |\n| Interpretability | Generally more interpretable | Often a \"black box\" |\n| Computational needs | Less intensive | Highly intensive |\n| Training time | Usually faster | Usually slower |\n| Best for | Structured data, smaller datasets | Complex tasks, unstructured data |",
